    [package.metadata.bootimage]
    # The command invoked with the created bootimage (the "{}" will be replaced
    # with the path to the bootable disk image)
    run-command = ["qemu-system-x86_64", "-drive", "format=raw,file={}"]
    # Additional arguments passed to the run command for non-test executables
    run-args = []
    # Additional arguments passed to the run command for test executables
    test-args = []
    # An exit code that should be considered as success for test executables
    test-success-exit-code = {integer}
    # The timeout for running a test (in seconds)
    test-timeout = 300
