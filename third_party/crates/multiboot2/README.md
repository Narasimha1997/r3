# Multiboot2: MBI + Header

This repository contains the crates `multiboot2` and `multiboot2-header`.
Please check their individual README-files ([multiboot2](multiboot2/README.md),
[multiboot2-header](multiboot2-header/README.md)).

The `multiboot2` crate helps to parse the Multiboot2 information structure
(MBI) and is relevant in kernels, that get booted by a bootloader such as
GRUB, for example. `multiboot2-header` helps you to either build
Multiboot2-headers yourself, or to parse Multiboot2 headers in custom bootloader
or similar applications.
